Project Overview
This website is created to fulfill the requirements of the coursework from Web Technologies module. 

The website is a page for English Study Centre in my neighbourhood, where I learned English and got IELTS. This website does not represent the actual information from the study centre except the links to the social media pages like instagram and telegram, to show this company/study centre actaully exists. In this website, there are 6 pages: Main Page, Courses, Free Lesson, Results, Location, FAQ - Frequent Asked Questions. In all pages, there is a header which shows the logo of the website and link to all pages of the website. By clicking logo you can get back to the main page. For the footer the links and phone number are given for contact information. The image of the person in the main page is AI generated and does not represent real person. The button "Sign up for Free lesson" leads to page where user can leave their name and phone number, so the adminstators of the study centre can get in touch later. In the courses page, info about the different courses are given, clicking buttons opens the page for signing up, which again user can leave their info. In the results page, fictional results of the people are shows in table format. In the location page, I have provided with random location, because it may not be good option to provide with the real location of the centre as it is private information. In the FAQ page, usually asked questions and answers are given, with cliking the questions, user can see the answers. As required in the coursework description, label saying “This website was created to fulfill Web Technology module requirements and does not represent an actual company or service” is written in every page.
